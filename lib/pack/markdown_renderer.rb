    # HACK: The "greatest_width" represents a terminal large enough to fit the
    # content without text wrapping. This (*roughly) corresponds with the width
    # of the longest line in the content.
    # * There are edge cases due to the content being padded and colourized
    #
    # As the content length must be equal or greater than its longest line; the
    # total length can be used as proxy. An additional terminal width is added
    # to handle (*most) of the edge cases.
    # * There still maybe a corner case when formatting a single paragraph
